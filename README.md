# Work-at-DouranGroup

This task is not meant to be a hard task, it is meant to gain some insight into candidates way of working and thinking. Therefore the level of ambition is very open to you. Recommended time frame is 2-3 hours. Feel free to use online resources or IDE to solve the problem, as long as you do not just copy-paste code. Libraries and similar is all fine to use.

We expect you to write the application as an app, and preferrably ReactJs.

1.Create an app from a template or from scratch.

2.Build admin dashboard(just build some charts and a table).

3.Use an API for real charts data and real tables data.

Optional Tasks :

• Make cool design for this!

• Make unit tests for the code.

• Make the sortable or searchable.
